# WP Theme Picker Control

## Description

This WordPress plugin creates a new control type for the [WordPress Theme Customizer](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API). This new control will allow you to pick a theme made up of various options with one click.

An example would be a theme with two different color palettes: a blue theme and a red theme. A user that clicks on the blue theme would then automatically set all other controls to the right settings to make the theme blue.

## Usage
